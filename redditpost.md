Creating 2D LoL game: looking for alpha-testers and artists

**Post**	
Since early October I have been working on my first game. It is based on League of Legends and uses some of its champions and its monsters. Currently I am in an early alpha stage, the latest version has a simple level, Ezreal and his spells, and, pretty important, movement and gravity.
The game is a **2D platformer**, where you will be able to **fight minions**, but also **jungle monsters**, as the Blue Golem, Dragon and **Baron**. The levels will have different themes, so you will fight each level in a different environment. I plan on adding a few champions, Ezreal is already added, Ahri is planned, maybe Teemo and a few more. You will be able to **choose which champ** you play. 

As said earlier, this is my first game. Therefore, do not expect a AAA game, but rather something simple. I learn as I create, and therefore it will not be released next week. I will be working on enemies the next couple of weeks. But, what is a game without awesome graphics?! Nothing. And since I am not such a great drawer, **I am looking for people that want to help me and create animations and environments**. If you are interested, PM me here on Reddit, leave a comment, contact via [GitHub](https://github.com/ikhebgeenaccount) or add me ingame on EUW: ikhebgeenaccount. 

Then the most important part of this whole wall of text: you guys probably want to get your hands on my game. I have a [pre-alpha version](https://github.com/ikhebgeenaccount/SideScroller/releases) ready for testing. If you don't want to download something, you can see what the current version holds in the [changelog](https://github.com/ikhebgeenaccount/SideScroller#sidescroller).

**TL;DR** - Creating a game, need help with graphics and such. Contact me if interested.
