##SideScroller

SideScroller aims to create a League of Legends themed 2D platformer. The project is far from finished. 

**Planned features:**
  - [ ] Levels with ending boss fights against Baron, Dragon, etc.
  - [ ] Passive and abilities from champions created in a 2D platformer
  - [ ] Great graphics
  
Would you like to help me with this project?  
I am currently looking for artists, to create animations and environments.  
PM [/u/ikhebgeenaccount](reddit.com/u/ikhebgeenaccount) or if you have no reddit, add me ingame on EUW: ikhebgeenaccount.  

Current version holds:  
  - Basic movement
  - Gravity

As you can see this project is far from finished. I am expecting (hoping) to be able to release a first beta early 2015.
